Benchpress
==========

Pit a few ruby methods against eachother, and chart it for great glory

Fair warning, this is super alpha one hour quick hack type material here. I intend to make it prettier later among other things, but I find it at least partially useful at this stage.

Props to the folks at Gruff (https://github.com/topfunky/gruff) for making this simpler to do, and to the Ruby team behind Benchmark.
